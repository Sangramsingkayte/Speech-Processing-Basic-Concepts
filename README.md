# Speech-Processing-Basic-Concepts
Basic Concepts: Articulatory Phonetics – the development and classification of speech sounds; Acoustic Phonetics – the acoustics of speech production; Review of Digital Signal Processing concepts; Short-Time Fourier Transform, Filter-Bank, and LPC Methods Techniques for Speech Analysis: Features, Feature Extraction, and Pattern Comparison: Log Spectral Distance, Cepstral Distances, Weighted Cepstral Distances and Filtering, Likelihood Distortions, Spectral Distortion using a Warped Frequency Scale, LPC, PLP, and MFCC Coefficients are both statistical and perceptual speech distortion measures. Multiple Time – Alignment Paths, Dynamic Time Warping, and Time Alignment and Normalization Remarks
